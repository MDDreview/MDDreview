This repository provides all R code for XXX (2020) **"The MDD concept for establishing trust in non-significant results - a critical review"**. 

The material is organized in two subfolders

* [**Publication**](https://github.com/MDDreview/MDDreview/tree/master/Publication): This subfolder contains the materials necessary to reproduce all simulations and analyses in XX (2020) 
  + Simulation 1 belongs to the section "Can the MDD discriminate between true and false negative tests?"
  + Simulation 2 belongs to the section "Sensitivity of the MDD and other statistical filters to real effect size"
* [**MDDshiny**](https://github.com/MDDreview/MDDreview/tree/master/MDDshiny): This subfolder contains a Shiny application reproducing the experimental simulations (1 and 2), allows to specify experimental statistical parameters, and produces Figures similar to Figures 5 and 6 in XXX (2020).
